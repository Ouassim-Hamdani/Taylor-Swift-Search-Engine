0,Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,0,"He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck"
1,Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,1,"That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone"
2,Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,2,"But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake"
3,Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,3,"When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans"
4,Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,4,"When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here"
5,Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,5,"To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back"
6,Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,6,"It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song"
7,Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,7,"The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress"

And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me"
9,Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,9,"And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read"

I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"""

14,Picture to Burn,Taylor Swift,0,"State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say"
15,Picture to Burn,Taylor Swift,1,"By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time"
16,Picture to Burn,Taylor Swift,2,"As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
There's nothing stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me"
17,Picture to Burn,Taylor Swift,3,"My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time"
18,Picture to Burn,Taylor Swift,4,"As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive"
19,Picture to Burn,Taylor Swift,5,"You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard

22,Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,0,"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be"
23,Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,1,"I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny"
24,Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,2,"That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night"
25,Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,3,"He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me"
26,Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,4,"Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love"
27,Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,5,"Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do"
28,Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,6,"So I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart"
29,Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,7,"He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me"
30,Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,8,"I fake a smile, so he won't see"
31,A Place In This World,Taylor Swift,0,"I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down"
32,A Place In This World,Taylor Swift,1,"Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on"
33,A Place In This World,Taylor Swift,2,"Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine"

And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
But that's okay
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
35,A Place In This World,Taylor Swift,4,"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly"

Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world"
37,A Place In This World,Taylor Swift,6,"Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh, I'm just a girl"
38,Cold as You,Taylor Swift,0,"You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted"
39,Cold as You,Taylor Swift,1,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say"
40,Cold as You,Taylor Swift,2,"And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away"
41,Cold as You,Taylor Swift,3,"And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day"
42,Cold as You,Taylor Swift,4,"So just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you"
43,Cold as You,Taylor Swift,5,"You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
If I died, died for you, died for you"
44,Cold as You,Taylor Swift,6,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day, oh
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made"
45,Cold as You,Taylor Swift,7,"And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
Ooh-oh"
46,The Outside,Taylor Swift,0,"I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go"
47,The Outside,Taylor Swift,1,"I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?"
48,The Outside,Taylor Swift,2,"Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places"
49,The Outside,Taylor Swift,3,"I've never been on the outside
You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you"
50,The Outside,Taylor Swift,4,"And now, it's all too late, so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything
How can I ever try to be better?"
51,The Outside,Taylor Swift,5,"Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places"
52,The Outside,Taylor Swift,6,"I've never been on the outside
Oh, yeah
How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in"

I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside"

Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh"
55,Tied Together with a Smile,Taylor Swift,0,"Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true"
56,Tied Together with a Smile,Taylor Swift,1,"'Cause I know you
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows"
57,Tied Together with a Smile,Taylor Swift,2,"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh"
58,Tied Together with a Smile,Taylor Swift,3,"I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket (Pocket)
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain"
59,Tied Together with a Smile,Taylor Swift,4,"Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go"

That you cry, but you don't tell anyone

And you're tied together with a smile"

You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh, oh-oh
Goodbye, baby"
64,Tied Together with a Smile,Taylor Swift,9,"With a smile, baby, baby
Oh"
65,Stay Beautiful,Taylor Swift,0,"Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows"
66,Stay Beautiful,Taylor Swift,1,"There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, ""Does he know?""
Will you ever know?"
67,Stay Beautiful,Taylor Swift,2,"You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for"

Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Cory finds another way to be"

I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation"

I should say, ""Hey, by the way""
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?"

And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door

You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone"

I hope your life leads you back to my front door

Na-na-na, na-na"
77,Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,0,"It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong"
78,Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,1,"You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes"
79,Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,2,"You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)"
80,Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,3,"And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no"
81,Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,4,"Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe"
82,Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,5,"We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness"
83,Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,6,"And you said yes
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word"
84,Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,7,"'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet"
85,Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,8,"You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, oh
I can't resist"
86,Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,9,"Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No, no"
87,Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,10,"No, no, no, no
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word"

90,Mary's Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,0,"She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us"
91,Mary's Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,1,"Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree"
92,Mary's Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,2,"Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried"
93,Mary's Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,3,"Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see"
94,Mary's Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,4,"But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes"
95,Mary's Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,5,"And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 AM riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me"
96,Mary's Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,6,"Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my"
97,Mary's Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,7,"A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle"
98,Mary's Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,8,"Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch"
99,Mary's Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,9,"After all this time, you and I
And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh, my, my, my"
100,Our Song,Taylor Swift,0,"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart"
101,Our Song,Taylor Swift,1,"I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song"""
102,Our Song,Taylor Swift,2,"And he says
Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow"
103,Our Song,Taylor Swift,3,"'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen"""
104,Our Song,Taylor Swift,4,"Askin' God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on"
105,Our Song,Taylor Swift,5,"And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said"
106,Our Song,Taylor Swift,6,"Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know"
107,Our Song,Taylor Swift,7,"Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again"
108,Our Song,Taylor Swift,8,"Da-da-da-da
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song"
109,Our Song,Taylor Swift,9,"'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know"
110,Our Song,Taylor Swift,10,"Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again"
111,Our Song,Taylor Swift,11,"Play it again, oh yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car"
112,Our Song,Taylor Swift,12,"I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"
113,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,Taylor Swift,0,"Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we don't say a thing"
114,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,Taylor Swift,1,"Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you"
115,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,Taylor Swift,2,"I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time"
116,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,Taylor Swift,3,"The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
Just a small-town boy and girl"
117,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,Taylor Swift,4,"Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears"
118,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,Taylor Swift,5,"Through it all, nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me
I'm only up when you're not down"
119,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,Taylor Swift,6,"Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to"
120,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,Taylor Swift,7,"Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself"
121,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,Taylor Swift,8,"And only you can tell
That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do"
122,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,Taylor Swift,9,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to

Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
Uh-huh-huh, yeah"
124,Invisible,Taylor Swift,0,"She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by"
125,Invisible,Taylor Swift,1,"And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you"
126,Invisible,Taylor Swift,2,"She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable"

Oh, yeah, oh
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through"
128,Invisible,Taylor Swift,4,"She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be"

She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me"

We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
Like shadows in a faded light"

I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize
I just wanna show you"
132,Invisible,Taylor Swift,8,"She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you, let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me"

She can't see the way your eyes"

135,A Perfectly Good Heart,Taylor Swift,0,"Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?"
136,A Perfectly Good Heart,Taylor Swift,1,"Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?"
137,A Perfectly Good Heart,Taylor Swift,2,"Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall"
138,A Perfectly Good Heart,Taylor Swift,3,"No matter what you say
I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but
Why would you wanna break"

Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make"

Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar

I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone"

I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends"

Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings"

My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer"
2460,Bejeweled,Midnights,2,"And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt"

When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice"
2462,Bejeweled,Midnights,4,"Nice
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve

But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancin' all night"

But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine"

How'd you turn it right around?"

And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time"

Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose"

And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then"

You see, all the wisest women
Had to do it this way"

I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleedin'
You were the one that I loved"

Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground"

Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember"

I vowed not to cry anymore
If we survived the Great War
You drew up some good faith treaties"

You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking"

Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it
All that bloodshed, crimson clover"

Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you"
2551,The Great War,Midnights,10,"We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back"

Uh-huh, the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War"

Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely, good money"

How you don't miss me in the shower"

And set fire to all my clothes
And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons"

3132,Macavity,Cats,2,"Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin

His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed"

3136,Macavity,Cats,6,"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there"
3137,Macavity,Cats,7,"And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime"

A brief interruption, a slight malfunction
I'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing"

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around"
3265,Crazier,The Hannah Montana Movie,2,"You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
I've watched from a distance as you made life your own"

3271,If This Was a Movie (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),0,"Last night, I heard my own heart beatin'
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reachin'
Even though I know you're not there"
3272,If This Was a Movie (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),1,"I was playin' back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you"
3273,If This Was a Movie (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),2,"Come back, come back, come back to me like

3275,If This Was a Movie (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),4,"But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them

You could, you could if you just said you're sorry"
3278,If This Was a Movie (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),7,"I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone"
3279,If This Was a Movie (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),8,"I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy"
3280,If This Was a Movie (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),9,"Before the fight, before I locked you out""
But I take it all back now
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie"

Oh, oh
Thought you'd be here by now"
